translate-activity
==================

Simple Sugar Activity to make use of
[translate](https://github.com/boredomist/translate).

Setup
-----

There are a few external dependencies that must be installed first (see 
[issue #6](https://github.com/boredomist/translate-activity/issues/6)).
Until this is changed, here's the process:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py dev
```

Easy enough.
